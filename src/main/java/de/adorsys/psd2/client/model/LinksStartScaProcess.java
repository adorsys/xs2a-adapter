 * NextGenPSD2 XS2A Framework
 * # Summary The **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.3.12* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely. The NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards  in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board, enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.  The possible Approaches are:   * Redirect SCA Approach    * OAuth SCA Approach   * Decoupled SCA Approach    * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method   * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available   * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method    Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.    Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional.   Therefore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support    a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.    **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure    which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**  ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification: * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.**    It is not a replacement in any sense.   The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API. * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.** * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.** * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]        \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"      The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.      The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,    but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.   Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.   We added them for the convenience of the user.   If there is a payment product, which needs these fields, one can easily use the predefined types.   But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.    * **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)    except they are mentioned in the Implementation Guidelines.**   Therefore the implementer might add these in his own realisation of a PSD2 complient API in addition to the elements defined in this file.     ## General Remarks on Data Types  The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API has to support at least the following characters  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  / - ? : ( ) . , ' +  Space

 * A list of hyperlinks to be recognised by the TPP. The actual hyperlinks used in the  response depend on the dynamical decisions of the ASPSP when processing the request.  **Remark:** All links can be relative or full links, to be decided by the ASPSP.  Type of links admitted in this response, (further links might be added for ASPSP defined  extensions):  - &#x27;scaRedirect&#x27;:    In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link to which to    redirect the PSU browser. - &#x27;scaOAuth&#x27;:    In case of a SCA OAuth2 Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the URI where the configuration of the Authorisation Server can be retrieved. The configuration follows the OAuth 2.0 Authorisation Server Metadata specification. * &#x27;confirmation&#x27;:    Might be added by the ASPSP if either the \&quot;scaRedirect\&quot; or \&quot;scaOAuth\&quot; hyperlink is returned    in the same response message.    This hyperlink defines the URL to the resource which needs to be updated with      * a confirmation code as retrieved after the plain redirect authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server or     * an access token as retrieved by submitting an authorization code after the integrated OAuth based authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server. - &#x27;updatePsuIdentification&#x27;:    The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,    where PSU identification data needs to be uploaded. - &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication&#x27;:   The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,    where PSU authentication data needs to be uploaded. - &#x27;startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication&#x27;:     Same as startAuthorisactionWithPsuAuthentication where the authentication data need to be encrypted on      application layer in uploading. - &#x27;selectAuthenticationMethod&#x27;:   The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,    where the selected authentication method needs to be uploaded.    This link is contained under exactly the same conditions as the data element &#x27;scaMethods&#x27;. - &#x27;authoriseTransaction&#x27;:   The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,    where the authorisation data has to be uploaded, e.g. the TOP received by SMS.  - &#x27;scaStatus&#x27;:    The link to retrieve the scaStatus of the corresponding authorisation sub-resource.
