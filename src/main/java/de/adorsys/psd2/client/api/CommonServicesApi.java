/*
 * NextGenPSD2 XS2A Framework
 * # Summary The **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.3.12* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely. The NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards  in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board, enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.  The possible Approaches are:   * Redirect SCA Approach    * OAuth SCA Approach   * Decoupled SCA Approach    * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method   * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available   * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method    Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.    Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional.   Therefore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support    a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.    **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure    which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**  ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification: * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.**    It is not a replacement in any sense.   The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API. * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.** * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.** * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]        \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"      The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.      The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,    but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.   Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.   We added them for the convenience of the user.   If there is a payment product, which needs these fields, one can easily use the predefined types.   But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.    * **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)    except they are mentioned in the Implementation Guidelines.**   Therefore the implementer might add these in his own realisation of a PSD2 complient API in addition to the elements defined in this file.     ## General Remarks on Data Types  The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API has to support at least the following characters  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  / - ? : ( ) . , ' +  Space

If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to be redirected for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the Embedded or the Decoupled SCA approach, depending on the parameter TPP-Decoupled-Preferred and the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU. If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  (optional)

If both parameters TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred are present and true, the request is still not rejected, but it is up to the ASPSP, which approach will actually be used.  **Remark for Future:**  TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred will be revised in future versions, maybe merged. Currently kept separate for downward compatibility.  (optional)

Mandated for the Redirect SCA Approach, specifically  when TPP-Redirect-Preferred equals \&quot;true\&quot;. It is recommended to always use this header field.  **Remark for Future:**  This field might be changed to mandatory in the next version of the specification.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNokRedirectURI If this URI is contained, the TPP is asking to redirect the transaction flow to this address instead of the TPP-Redirect-URI in case of a negative result of the redirect SCA method. This might be ignored by the ASPSP.  (optional)

For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:  URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.  Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.  ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNotificationContentPreferred The string has the form   status&#x3D;X1, ..., Xn  where Xi is one of the constants SCA, PROCESS, LAST and where constants are not repeated. The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:    SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.    PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.   LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.  This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.  (optional)
     * @param psUIPAddress The forwarded IP Address header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request  IP Address field between PSU and TPP.  It shall be contained if and only if this request was actively initiated by the PSU.  (optional)

     * Start the authorisation process for a consent
     * Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a consent.  The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.  his method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a  corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for  the corresponding PSU authorising the consent.  The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary,  since the related authorisation resource will be automatically created by  the ASPSP after the submission of the consent data with the first POST consents call.  The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation  or cancellation sub-resource.   This applies in the following scenarios:    * The ASPSP has indicated with an &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceding Payment      initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be      uploaded by using the extended forms:     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification&#x27;,      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication&#x27;      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication&#x27;     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection&#x27;    * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.   * The ASPSP has indicated with an &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceding      payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded      by using the extended forms as indicated above.   * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for      executing the cancellation.   * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet. 
     * @param xRequestID ID of the request, unique to the call, as determined by the initiating party. (required)
     * @param consentId ID of the corresponding consent object as returned by an account information consent request.  (required)
     * @param body  (optional)
     * @param digest Is contained if and only if the \&quot;Signature\&quot; element is contained in the header of the request. (optional)
     * @param signature A signature of the request by the TPP on application level. This might be mandated by ASPSP.  (optional)
     * @param tpPSignatureCertificate The certificate used for signing the request, in base64 encoding.  Must be contained if a signature is contained.  (optional)
     * @param PSU_ID Client ID of the PSU in the ASPSP client interface.   Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation.  It might be contained even if an OAuth2 based authentication was performed in a pre-step or an OAuth2 based SCA was performed in an preceding AIS service in the same session. In this case the ASPSP might check whether PSU-ID and token match,  according to ASPSP documentation.  (optional)
     * @param psUIDType Type of the PSU-ID, needed in scenarios where PSUs have several PSU-IDs as access possibility.  In this case, the mean and use are then defined in the ASPSP’s documentation.  (optional)
     * @param psUCorporateID Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation. Only used in a corporate context.  (optional)
     * @param psUCorporateIDType Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation. Only used in a corporate context.  (optional)
     * @param tpPRedirectPreferred If it equals \&quot;true\&quot;, the TPP prefers a redirect over an embedded SCA approach. If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to be redirected for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the Embedded or the Decoupled SCA approach, depending on the parameter TPP-Decoupled-Preferred and the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU. If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  (optional)
     * @param tpPDecoupledPreferred If it equals \&quot;true\&quot;, the TPP prefers a decoupled SCA approach.  If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to use the decoupled approach for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the embedded or the redirect SCA approach, depending on the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU.  If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the parameter TPP-Redirect-Preferred and the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  The parameter might be ignored by the ASPSP. If both parameters TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred are present and true, the request is still not rejected, but it is up to the ASPSP, which approach will actually be used.  **Remark for Future:**  TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred will be revised in future versions, maybe merged. Currently kept separate for downward compatibility.  (optional)
     * @param tpPRedirectURI URI of the TPP, where the transaction flow shall be redirected to after a Redirect.  Mandated for the Redirect SCA Approach, specifically  when TPP-Redirect-Preferred equals \&quot;true\&quot;. It is recommended to always use this header field.  **Remark for Future:**  This field might be changed to mandatory in the next version of the specification.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNokRedirectURI If this URI is contained, the TPP is asking to redirect the transaction flow to this address instead of the TPP-Redirect-URI in case of a negative result of the redirect SCA method. This might be ignored by the ASPSP.  (optional)

For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:  URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.  Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.  ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNotificationContentPreferred The string has the form   status&#x3D;X1, ..., Xn  where Xi is one of the constants SCA, PROCESS, LAST and where constants are not repeated. The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:    SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.    PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.   LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.  This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.  (optional)
     * @param psUIPAddress The forwarded IP Address header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request  IP Address field between PSU and TPP.  It shall be contained if and only if this request was actively initiated by the PSU.  (optional)

     * Start the authorisation process for a consent (asynchronously)
     * Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a consent.  The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.  his method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a  corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for  the corresponding PSU authorising the consent.  The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary,  since the related authorisation resource will be automatically created by  the ASPSP after the submission of the consent data with the first POST consents call.  The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation  or cancellation sub-resource.   This applies in the following scenarios:    * The ASPSP has indicated with an &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceding Payment      initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be      uploaded by using the extended forms:     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification&#x27;,      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication&#x27;      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication&#x27;     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection&#x27;    * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.   * The ASPSP has indicated with an &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceding      payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded      by using the extended forms as indicated above.   * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for      executing the cancellation.   * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet. 
     * @param xRequestID ID of the request, unique to the call, as determined by the initiating party. (required)
     * @param consentId ID of the corresponding consent object as returned by an account information consent request.  (required)
     * @param body  (optional)
     * @param digest Is contained if and only if the \&quot;Signature\&quot; element is contained in the header of the request. (optional)
     * @param signature A signature of the request by the TPP on application level. This might be mandated by ASPSP.  (optional)
     * @param tpPSignatureCertificate The certificate used for signing the request, in base64 encoding.  Must be contained if a signature is contained.  (optional)
     * @param PSU_ID Client ID of the PSU in the ASPSP client interface.   Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation.  It might be contained even if an OAuth2 based authentication was performed in a pre-step or an OAuth2 based SCA was performed in an preceding AIS service in the same session. In this case the ASPSP might check whether PSU-ID and token match,  according to ASPSP documentation.  (optional)
     * @param psUIDType Type of the PSU-ID, needed in scenarios where PSUs have several PSU-IDs as access possibility.  In this case, the mean and use are then defined in the ASPSP’s documentation.  (optional)
     * @param psUCorporateID Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation. Only used in a corporate context.  (optional)
     * @param psUCorporateIDType Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation. Only used in a corporate context.  (optional)
     * @param tpPRedirectPreferred If it equals \&quot;true\&quot;, the TPP prefers a redirect over an embedded SCA approach. If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to be redirected for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the Embedded or the Decoupled SCA approach, depending on the parameter TPP-Decoupled-Preferred and the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU. If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  (optional)
     * @param tpPDecoupledPreferred If it equals \&quot;true\&quot;, the TPP prefers a decoupled SCA approach.  If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to use the decoupled approach for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the embedded or the redirect SCA approach, depending on the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU.  If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the parameter TPP-Redirect-Preferred and the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  The parameter might be ignored by the ASPSP. If both parameters TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred are present and true, the request is still not rejected, but it is up to the ASPSP, which approach will actually be used.  **Remark for Future:**  TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred will be revised in future versions, maybe merged. Currently kept separate for downward compatibility.  (optional)
     * @param tpPRedirectURI URI of the TPP, where the transaction flow shall be redirected to after a Redirect.  Mandated for the Redirect SCA Approach, specifically  when TPP-Redirect-Preferred equals \&quot;true\&quot;. It is recommended to always use this header field.  **Remark for Future:**  This field might be changed to mandatory in the next version of the specification.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNokRedirectURI If this URI is contained, the TPP is asking to redirect the transaction flow to this address instead of the TPP-Redirect-URI in case of a negative result of the redirect SCA method. This might be ignored by the ASPSP.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNotificationURI URI for the Endpoint of the TPP-API to which the status of the payment initiation should be sent. This header field may by ignored by the ASPSP.  For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:  URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.  Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.  ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNotificationContentPreferred The string has the form   status&#x3D;X1, ..., Xn  where Xi is one of the constants SCA, PROCESS, LAST and where constants are not repeated. The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:    SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.    PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.   LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.  This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.  (optional)
     * @param psUIPAddress The forwarded IP Address header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request  IP Address field between PSU and TPP.  It shall be contained if and only if this request was actively initiated by the PSU.  (optional)
     * @param psUIPPort The forwarded IP Port header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request IP Port field between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)
     * @param psUAccept The forwarded IP Accept header fields consist of the corresponding HTTP request Accept header fields between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)
     * @param psUAcceptCharset The forwarded IP Accept header fields consist of the corresponding HTTP request Accept header fields between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)
     * @param psUAcceptEncoding The forwarded IP Accept header fields consist of the corresponding HTTP request Accept header fields between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)
     * @param psUAcceptLanguage The forwarded IP Accept header fields consist of the corresponding HTTP request Accept header fields between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)
     * @param psUUserAgent The forwarded Agent header field of the HTTP request between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)
     * @param psUHttpMethod HTTP method used at the PSU ? TPP interface, if available. Valid values are: * GET * POST * PUT * PATCH * DELETE  (optional)
     * @param psUDeviceID UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) for a device, which is used by the PSU, if available. UUID identifies either a device or a device dependant application installation. In case of an installation identification this ID needs to be unaltered until removal from device.  (optional)
     * @param psUGeoLocation The forwarded Geo Location of the corresponding http request between PSU and TPP if available.  (optional)
     * @param callback The callback to be executed when the API call finishes

It might be contained even if an OAuth2 based authentication was performed in a pre-step or an OAuth2 based SCA was performed in an preceding AIS service in the same session. In this case the ASPSP might check whether PSU-ID and token match,  according to ASPSP documentation.  (optional)

Mandated for the Redirect SCA Approach, specifically  when TPP-Redirect-Preferred equals \&quot;true\&quot;. It is recommended to always use this header field.  **Remark for Future:**  This field might be changed to mandatory in the next version of the specification.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNokRedirectURI If this URI is contained, the TPP is asking to redirect the transaction flow to this address instead of the TPP-Redirect-URI in case of a negative result of the redirect SCA method. This might be ignored by the ASPSP.  (optional)

PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.   LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.  This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.  (optional)

It might be contained even if an OAuth2 based authentication was performed in a pre-step or an OAuth2 based SCA was performed in an preceding AIS service in the same session. In this case the ASPSP might check whether PSU-ID and token match,  according to ASPSP documentation.  (optional)

     * Start the authorisation process for a signing basket
     * Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a signing basket.  The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.  This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a  corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for  the corresponding PSU authorising the signing-baskets.  The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case  of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource  might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the  payment data with the first POST signing basket call.  The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation  or cancellation sub-resource.   This applies in the following scenarios:    * The ASPSP has indicated with a &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceding payment      initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be      uploaded by using the extended forms:     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification&#x27;,      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication&#x27;      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication&#x27;     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection&#x27;    * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.   * The ASPSP has indicated with a &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceding      payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.     The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded     by using the extended forms as indicated above.   * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for      executing the cancellation.   * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet. 
     * @param xRequestID ID of the request, unique to the call, as determined by the initiating party. (required)
     * @param basketId This identification of the corresponding signing basket object.  (required)
     * @param body  (optional)
     * @param digest Is contained if and only if the \&quot;Signature\&quot; element is contained in the header of the request. (optional)
     * @param signature A signature of the request by the TPP on application level. This might be mandated by ASPSP.  (optional)
     * @param tpPSignatureCertificate The certificate used for signing the request, in base64 encoding.  Must be contained if a signature is contained.  (optional)
     * @param PSU_ID Client ID of the PSU in the ASPSP client interface.   Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation.  It might be contained even if an OAuth2 based authentication was performed in a pre-step or an OAuth2 based SCA was performed in an preceding AIS service in the same session. In this case the ASPSP might check whether PSU-ID and token match,  according to ASPSP documentation.  (optional)
     * @param psUIDType Type of the PSU-ID, needed in scenarios where PSUs have several PSU-IDs as access possibility.  In this case, the mean and use are then defined in the ASPSP’s documentation.  (optional)
     * @param psUCorporateID Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation. Only used in a corporate context.  (optional)
     * @param psUCorporateIDType Might be mandated in the ASPSP&#x27;s documentation. Only used in a corporate context.  (optional)
     * @param tpPRedirectPreferred If it equals \&quot;true\&quot;, the TPP prefers a redirect over an embedded SCA approach. If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to be redirected for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the Embedded or the Decoupled SCA approach, depending on the parameter TPP-Decoupled-Preferred and the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU. If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  (optional)
     * @param tpPDecoupledPreferred If it equals \&quot;true\&quot;, the TPP prefers a decoupled SCA approach.  If it equals \&quot;false\&quot;, the TPP prefers not to use the decoupled approach for SCA. The ASPSP will then choose between the embedded or the redirect SCA approach, depending on the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU.  If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the parameter TPP-Redirect-Preferred and the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.  The parameter might be ignored by the ASPSP. If both parameters TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred are present and true, the request is still not rejected, but it is up to the ASPSP, which approach will actually be used.  **Remark for Future:**  TPP-Redirect-Preferred and TPP-Decoupled-Preferred will be revised in future versions, maybe merged. Currently kept separate for downward compatibility.  (optional)
     * @param tpPRedirectURI URI of the TPP, where the transaction flow shall be redirected to after a Redirect.  Mandated for the Redirect SCA Approach, specifically  when TPP-Redirect-Preferred equals \&quot;true\&quot;. It is recommended to always use this header field.  **Remark for Future:**  This field might be changed to mandatory in the next version of the specification.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNokRedirectURI If this URI is contained, the TPP is asking to redirect the transaction flow to this address instead of the TPP-Redirect-URI in case of a negative result of the redirect SCA method. This might be ignored by the ASPSP.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNotificationURI URI for the Endpoint of the TPP-API to which the status of the payment initiation should be sent. This header field may by ignored by the ASPSP.  For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:  URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.  Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.  ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.  (optional)
     * @param tpPNotificationContentPreferred The string has the form   status&#x3D;X1, ..., Xn  where Xi is one of the constants SCA, PROCESS, LAST and where constants are not repeated. The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:    SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.    PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.   LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.  This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.  (optional)
     * @param psUIPAddress The forwarded IP Address header field consists of the corresponding http request IP Address field between PSU and TPP.  (optional)
     * @param psUIPPort The forwarded IP Port header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request IP Port field between PSU and TPP, if available.  (optional)

This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed.   There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The Update PSU data request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.

This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed.   There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a cancellation authorisation within the payment initiation services needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The Update PSU data request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.  There are the following request types on this access path:   * Update PSU identification   * Update PSU authentication   * Select PSU authorization method      WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,      therefore many optional elements are not present.

     * Update PSU data for payment initiation (asynchronously)
     * This methods updates PSU data on the authorisation resource if needed.  It may authorise a payment within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.  Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of  the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.  There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of payment initiation services needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific update PSU data request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the account information consent request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The Update PSU Data request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible Update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.  There are the following request types on this access path:   * Update PSU identification   * Update PSU authentication   * Select PSU authorization method      WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,      therefore many optional elements are not present.

     * Update PSU data for signing basket (asynchronously)
     * This method update PSU data on the signing basket resource if needed.  It may authorise a igning basket within the embedded SCA approach where needed.  Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of  the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.  This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed.   There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the account information consent request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The update PSU data request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.  There are the following request types on this access path:   * Update PSU identification   * Update PSU authentication   * Select PSU authorization Method      WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,      therefore many optional elements are not present.      Maybe in a later version the access path will change.   * Transaction Authorisation     WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,      therefore many optional elements are not present.
