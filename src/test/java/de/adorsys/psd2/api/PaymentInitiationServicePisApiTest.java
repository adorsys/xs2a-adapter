 * BG PSD2 API
 * # Summary The **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.2* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely.  The NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards  in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board, enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service')  by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.  The possible Approaches are:   * Redirect SCA Approach   * OAuth SCA Approach   * Decoupled SCA Approach   * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method   * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available   * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method    Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.    Futhermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional   Therfore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support    a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.    **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure    which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**  ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification: * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.**    It is not an replacement in any sense.   The main specification is (at the moment) allways the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API. * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.** * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.** * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]        \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"      The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.      The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,    but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.   Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.   We added them for the convinience of the user.   If there is a payment product, which need these field, one can easily use the predefined types.   But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.    * **We ommit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)    except they are mention in the Implementation Guidelines.**   Therefore the implementer might add the in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements define in this file.     ## General Remarks on Data Types  The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API have to support at least the following characters  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  / - ? : ( ) . , ' +  Space

     * Payment initiation request

     * This method is used to initiate a payment at the ASPSP.  ## Variants of Payment Initiation Requests  This method to initiate a payment initiation at the ASPSP can be sent with either a JSON body or an pain.001 body depending on the payment product in the path.  There are the following **payment products**:    - Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:     - ***sepa-credit-transfers***     - ***instant-sepa-credit-transfers***     - ***target-2-payments***     - ***cross-border-credit-transfers***   - Payment products with payment information in *pain.001* XML format:     - ***pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers***     - ***pain.001-instant-sepa-credit-transfers***     - ***pain.001-target-2-payments***     - ***pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers***  Furthermore the request body depends on the **payment-service**   * ***payments***: A single payment initiation request.   * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment iniatiation requests.        In case of a *pain.001* message there are more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.          In case of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining list.   * ***periodic-payments***:      Create a standing order initiation resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId}       with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body.   This is the first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.    ## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes  The Payment Initiation Requests are independent from the need of one ore multilevel  SCA processing, i.e. independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of payments.   But the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing or multilevel SCA processing.   For payment initiation with multilevel SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation,  i.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like &#x27;scaRedirect&#x27; or &#x27;scaOAuth&#x27; cannot be contained in the  response message of a Payment Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed.  Also if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA method is not supported in the response,  since all starts of the multiple authorisations are fully equal.  In these cases, first an authorisation sub-resource has to be generated following the &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; link.

The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation  or cancellation sub-resource.   This applies in the following scenarios:    * The ASPSP has indicated with an &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceeding Payment      Initiation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be      uploaded by using the extended forms.     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication&#x27;,      * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication&#x27;     * &#x27;startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection&#x27;    * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.   * The ASPSP has indicated with an &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink in the preceeding      Payment Cancellation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The &#x27;startAuthorisation&#x27; hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded      by using the extended forms as indicated above.   * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for      executing the cancellation.   * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.
