== Notices:
- improved request/response body validation of WiremockStubDifferenceDetectingInterceptor, it validates json field values
from now on.
- updated release script, added parameters for avoiding timeout error when publishing artifacts on Maven Central.
- changes in `crealogix-adapter`, PreAuthorisationException is a child of RequestValidationException now and can be handled
by a client validation resolver.

== Features:

== Fixes:
- fixing `crealogix-adapter`, the provider has changed its Oauth Embedded Pre-Step flow which broke the adapter. Implemented
changes will handle a new flow. Also, there is no need for any DKB secrets and keys.
- for `crealogix-adapter`, removed Authorization header checking because DKB requires a registration by calling an arbitrary
XS2A endpoint for the first time. For avoiding burdening a client with manual registration Adapter will make the first call
of Create Consent or Initiate Payment, which should always return 401 UNAUTHORIZED.
