== Notices:
- for `crealogix-adapter`: extended logging if getToken request fails, all logs are sanitized.
- for `crealogix-adapter`: Authorization header is resolved correctly now, it's decoded and split into Authorization
and PSD2-AUTHORIZATION headers.

== Features:

== Fixes:
- fixed DKB `PSD2-AUTHORIZATION` header, it contains Base64 encoded value of `TPP-ID:TPP-SECRET` now
- fixed 406 error in `verlag-adapter` for `getTransactionList` call, if the `Accept` header has _accept all_ ("\*/*")
value or is absent, the **text/plain** value is provided.
- fixed bug in WiremockStubDifferenceDetectingInterceptor, isWiremockSupported method checks `mappings` directory
presence in an adapter as intended.
- fixed bug in `crealogix-adapter`: Authorization header credentials type recognized and checked correctly now.
