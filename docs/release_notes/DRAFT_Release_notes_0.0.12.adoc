== Notices:
- PSD2 API has been removed.
- Number of copies of schema classes was reduced from 4 to 1.
The remaining set is generated from the yaml file into xs2a-adapter-generated-api module (`api.model` package).
This fixes the issue of model copies getting out-of-sync and prevents its occurrence in the future.
- Generated rest api has been moved to `rest.api` package.
- Added equals and hashCode methods to generated models.
- `fromValue` static factory methods of generated enums returns null for unrecognizied values instead of throwing an exception.

== Fixes:
Fixed wrong OAuth param validation for Comdirect, Commerzbank and Sparkasse
