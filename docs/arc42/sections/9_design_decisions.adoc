== 9. Design Decisions.
=== 9.1. WireMock.

.Motivation.

It can be nice to have an opportunity for testing an XS2A Adapter user solution without an actual interaction with a bank
sandbox or production environment.

.Decision.

_WireMock_ is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs for stubbing and mocking web services.

=== 9.2. Apache HTTP Client.

.Motivation.

XS2A Adapter must communicate with a bank via HTTP protocols, thus an efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich HTTP
client with the most recent protocol standards and recommendations is needed.

.Decision.

_Apache HTTP Client_ is a robust, versatile java based library for building HTTP-aware client applications.

=== 9.3. Mapstruct.

.Motivation.

XS2A Adapter sometimes must work with bank models that are not BG compliant, thereby a mapping to an appropriate analogue
should be performed, which is onerous and error-prone if implemented manually.

.Decision.

_Mapstruct_ is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between java bean types based on
convention over configuration approach.

=== 9.4. Javatar-commons.

.Motivation.
Some XS2A models are big and complex and cumbersome to build programmatically for testing purposes. Would be nice to drop
model creating from the test and be able to deserialize it from JSON or YAML representation.

.Decision.
_javatar-commons_ - a convenient set of JSON and YAML reading and deserialization utils.

=== 9.5. Bouncy Castle.

.Motivation.
XS2A Adapter must load a specific certificate for password encryption for Deutsche Bank, need a tool for obtaining a bank
certificate.

.Decision.
_Bouncy Castle_ is a collection of APIs used in cryptography, including deserializing a certificate from an input stream.

=== 9.6. Nimbus-jose-jwt.

.Motivation.
In Deutsche Bank case, PSU password should be encrypted based on JWE https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516[RFC7516] specification.

.Decision.
_nimbus-jose-jwt_ is a popular and robust Java and Android library for JSON Web Token (JWT), standard signature (JWS),
amd encryption (JWE).

=== 9.7. Webjars-locator.

.Motivation.
It would be nice to have a possibility for avoiding onerous supporting of webjars resource versioning for Swagger-UI.

.Decision.
_webjars-locator_ - a library to automatically resolve the version of any Webjar assets.

=== 9.8. Postman.

.Motivation.
Provide a convenient way of testing XS2A Adapter REST interface. Also, it should be a CLI for testing the API in a pipeline.

.Decision.
_Postman_ is an API platform for building and using APIs. XS2A Adapter provides a ready to use postman
https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a-adapter/tree/develop/postman[collections] for testing API locally.

=== 9.9. Sonar.

.Motivation.
Nice to have a system for monitoring code quality, decrease bug appearance and avoid code smells.

.Decision.
_Sonar_ - open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.

=== 9.10. Swagger-UI.

.Motivation.
XS2A Adapter REST API should be represented visually (online) in an accessible and understandable way, following OpenAPI
specification, based on available JSON file.

.Decision.
_Swagger-UI_ Swagger UI allows anyone to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of
the implementation logic in place.
