=== 10.2. Quality Scenarios.

.Understandability / Clear for users.
XS2A Adapter should be easy and low cost to deploy, set up, and launch in a user environment.

.Understandability / Clear for contributors.
A potential contributor should be provided with necessary documentation and manuals for extending, improving an old adapter,
or creating a new one.

.Interoperability / Open and completely understood interface.
XS2A Adapter API must be open to the public, clear in details and low time and cost for utilizing as a library or
a standalone application.

.Testability / Coverage
XS2A Adapter test coverage should be above 80%.

.Testability / Independent from a bank accessibility.
XS2A Adapter should provide a clear way to be tested (e.g. integration or system tests) as a part of a user solution
without actual communication with a bank, which can be achieved via using https://adorsys.github.io/xs2a-adapter/wiremock-mode[WireMock mode].

.Error transparent / Exceptions from ASPSPs must be passed
Original errors and exceptions from an ASPSP should be passed to an end-user (TPP) or at least logged for later tackling.

.Validations clear / Adapter validation remarks should be clear
XS2A Adapter Validation Error must contain enough description for a user to determine and fix a cause.

.Data mask / Sensitive information must be concealed
Data that can be considered as a user sensitive must be masked via HttpLogSanitizer.
