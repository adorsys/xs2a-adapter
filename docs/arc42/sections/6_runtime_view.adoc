2. ASPSP Registry returns the list of supported adapters. The result list is empty
when searched bank is unsupported.
3. TPP chooses and stores the ASPSP ID
4. TPP makes call to a bank via XS2A Adapter with ASPSP ID in the request headers
5. XS2A Core gets bank adapter details from ASPSP Registry
6. ASPSP Registry returns bank adapter details
7. XS2A Core sends initial TPP request to the specific bank adapter
8. ASPSP Adapter converts request regarding bank needs
9. ASPSP Adapter sends converted request to the bank
10. ASPSP Adapter receives response from the bank
11. ASPSP Adapter converts bank response to the XS2A Adapter model
12. ASPSP Adapter sends converts response to XS2A Core
13. XS2A Core replies with the converted response to TPP
