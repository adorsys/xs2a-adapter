== 8. Cross-cutting Concepts.

=== 8.1. XS2A Adapter Domain Model.
The main goal of the XS2A Adapter is to normalize a request/response to/from a bank to be compliant to the Berlin Group PSD2 specification.


==== 8.1.1. XS2A Request/Response flow overview.
Request/response processing are mostly done in the specific adapter, but a request/response is passed through several layers until it reaches
an adapter.

.XS2A Adapter Activity
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Module |Description
|TPP |Third Party Payment Service Provider, a client of the XS2A Adapter.
|Adapter REST Interface |Receives requests and sends responses from/to a client, delegates a request to the ASPSP Registry
or to the Adapter Service Loader.
|Adapter ASPSP Registry |Retrieves an ASPSP information from a Lucene repository by a provided input.
|Adapter Service Loader |Loads an appropriate XS2A Adapter and delegates a request to it.
|Adapters |Collection of implemented bank adapters.
|Adapter Service Implementation |Module with base service implementations to deal with a request.
|X Adapter |A specific XS2A Adapter that performs the request/response normalization and calls an appropriate bank.

|===

There is no main Request or Response models in XS2A Adapter. Almost each operation has its own request/response structure,
these are models based on the Berlin Group specification. Full list and descriptions are available in the https://xs2a-adapter-integ.cloud.adorsys.de/swagger-ui.html[swagger file].

==== 8.1.2. XS2A Adapter REST Interface.

https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads[Berlin Group Specification] provides comprehensive documentation on the PSD2 XS2A Interface.

==== 8.1.3. XS2A Adapter ASPSP Registry.

Adapter ASPSP Registry is sufficiently described in xref:whitebox_aspsp_registry[Whitebox ASPSP Registry]

==== 8.1.4. XS2A Adapter Service Loader.

Adapter Service Loader responsibility is to provide an appropriate XS2A Adapter to deal with a request/response routine.
The structure is the next:

image::adapter-service-loader.png[XS2A Adapter Service Loader,width=100%]

.XS2A Adapter Service Loader
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Class/Interface |Description
|AdapterServiceLoader |The class resolves which particular adapter should be called.

|AccountInformationService |The interface determines operations for retrieving account information, consent creation,
PSU authentication and authorisation. Based on PSD2 Berlin Group specification.

==== 8.1.5. XS2A Adapter Service Implementation.

All base service implementations are located in the Adapter Service Implementation module:

image::adapter-service-impl.png[XS2A Adapter Service Implementation,width=100%]

|===

The full list of the AIS operations is put down xref:account_information_service[here] and PIS operations are xref:payment_initiation_service[here]

==== 8.1.6. X-Adapter.

Normalization of a request/response takes place in a particular X-Adapter:

image::x-adapter.png[X-Adapter,width=100%]

.X Adapter
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Class/Interface |Description
|XAdapterServiceProvider |Child of a AbstractAdapterServiceProvider with a specific bank implementations.
|XAccountInformationService |Child of a BaseAccountInformationService with a specific bank implementations.
|XPaymentInitiationService |Child of a BasePaymentInitiationService with a specific bank implementations.
|===

=== 8.2. Inheritance of the base services.

Creating an adapter is achieved via extending base services: AIS, PIS, OAuth2, etc.

A concrete adapter is merely simple as all main operations are performed in the base Account Information and
Payment Initiation services. Also, not all adapters need to extend a base service to add a specific change, a bank can have
a perfectly valid BG interface, so a base service is enough for connecting to an ASPSP.

image::account-information-service-tree.png[AIS child tree]
image::payment-initiation-service-tree.png[PIS child tree]

However, all adapters must extend AbstractAdapterServiceProvider that implements AccountInformationServiceProvider and
PaymentInitiationServiceProvider for proper Service Loader work.

image::adapter-service-provider-tree.png[Adapter Service Provider tree, width=960]

There are additional constrains on an adapter which listed https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a-adapter/blob/develop/docs/Adapter.md[here].

=== 8.3. Http Client and Request/Response Interceptor.

XS2A Adapter provides its own HTTP Client implementations: ApacheHttpClient, WiremockHttpClient.

image::adapter-http-client.png[XS2A Adapter HTTP Client,width=100%]

.XS2A Adapter HttpClient
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Class/Interface |Description
|HttpClient |Interface provides the list of operations for a client.
|ResponseHandler |Functional Interface for operation of handling a bank response.
|AbstractHttpClient |Abstract class provides base implementation or Get, Post, Put, and Delete operations.
|ApacheHttpClient |Main implementation of the HttpClient that uses the https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/[Apache Components] solution.
|WiremockHttpClient |A client on top of the ApacheHttpClient, that palms off a recorded bank response instead of
communicating to a real bank.
|===

More details on WireMock will come below.

To be able to modify a specific aspect of a request an Interceptor interface was introduced. With an interceptor a client
can pre- or post-handle a call to a bank.

image::adapter-interceptor.png[XS2A Adapter Interceptor,width=100%]

.XS2A Adapter Interceptor
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Class/Interface |Description

|consors.PsuIdHeaderInterceptor |Clears PSU-ID header if it contains mere quotes (*""*) for Consors.
|deutschebank.PsuIdHeaderInterceptor |Normalize PSU-ID header if necessary for a specific Deutsche Bank branches.
|deutschebank.PsuIdTypeHeaderInterceptor |Adds a defined value of PSU-ID-Type header based on a specific Deutsche Bank branch.
|verlag.PsuIdTypeHeaderInterceptor |Removes a PSU-ID-Type header if it contains an empty value for banks that use Verlag solutions.

|adapter.impl.http.RequestSigningInterceptor |Base singing request interceptor.
|adapter.impl.http.wiremock.WiremockStubDifferenceDetectingInterceptor |Detects differences between a performed request and
recorded wiremock stubs.
|===

=== 8.4. WireMock.

For convenient testing of a client solution XS2A Adapter introduced a WireMock mode. In this configuration the adapter
itself doesn't communicate with a real bank but returns a request/response record (also called a stub).

.XS2A Flow in WireMock mode
image::adapter-wiremock-mode.png[XS2A Flow in WireMock mode,width=100%]

A comprehensive description about XS2A Adapter WireMock mode can be found https://adorsys.github.io/xs2a-adapter/wiremock-mode[here].

=== 8.5. XS2A Adapter Exceptions.

XS2A Adapter developed its own set of exceptions that can occur in specific situations. All of them are subtypes of RuntimeException.

.XS2A Adapter Exceptions
image::adapter-exceptions.png[XS2A Adapter Exceptions,width=100%]

.XS2A Adapter Exceptions

|===

_* HTTP Status depends on the status from the bank response_

=== 8.6. XS2A Adapter configuration properties.

XS2A Adapter expects to have `adapter.config.properties` with configuration key-value pairs for some adapters.

Those properties are parsed by AdapterConfig service, which uses `java.util.Properties` under the hood.

.AdapterConfig
image::adapter-config.png[XS2A Adapter configuration,width=100%]

AdapterConfig interface provides reading properties operations and loading a new properties file, mostly for test purposes.

Additional details on the XS2A Adapter properties are https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a-adapter/blob/develop/docs/configuration.md[here].

=== 8.7. XS2A Adapter Pkcs12KeyStore.

In order to interact with the Banks' XS2A Interfaces, a user will need to have an eIDAS certificate. XS2A Adapter expects
a user to supply a valid PKCS #12 Key Store file (.p12) with a certificate as a JVM parameter (standalone)
or as a parameter in the Pkcs12KeyStore constructor (library).

Description of the KeyStore and how to create it is already put down in https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a-adapter/blob/develop/docs/keystore.md[here]

=== 8.8. XS2A Adapter Request Signing.

XS2A Adapter can sign the request for a user, if an adapter applied `RequestSigningInterceptor` and has a QSEAL
certificate in a key store. In some specific cases (like ING) an adapter will have its own signing service.
