=== Non-XS2A Interfaces.

XS2A Adapter handles specific cases that are not specified or scarcely described in the PSD2 Berlin Group Specification.

==== OAuth2 Service.

*Intent/Responsibility:* This is API for supporting OAuth flow.

.OAuth2 Service Interface (with REST endpoints)
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Method |Description
|getAuthorizationRequestUri

GET _/oauth2/authorization-request-uri_
|Retrieves an authorization URL from a bank IDP server and supplies necessary parameters for

|getToken

POST _/v1/embedded-pre-auth/token_
|Exchanges user credentials for a bearer token.
|===

=== XS2A Adapter Specific Interfaces.

For Adapter to address the request to a specific bank a bank adapter identifier is a must. To tackle a problem ASPSP Repository
was introduced. It traverses through the Lucene Repository that persists all available bank (ASPSP) records.

==== ASPSP Read Only Repository Service.

*Intent/Responsibility:* Lookup for an appropriate adapter by incoming parameters.

.ASPSP Read Only Repository Interface (Library)
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Method |Description
|findById |Retrieves an ASPSP by provided ID.
|findByBic |Retrieves all ASPSPs by provided BIC.
|findByBankCode |Retrieves all ASPSPs by provided BLZ (Bank Code).
|findByName |Retrieves all ASPSPs by provided Bank Name.
|findAll |Retrieves all ASPSPs from the Repository.
|findLike |Retrieves all ASPSPs by provided set of data (e.g. BIC and Bank Name).
|findByIban |Retrieves an ASPSP by provided IBAN.
|===

The REST Client of the ASPSP Repository is also available, however its interface is simplified.

.ASPSP Repository REST Interface (Standalone)
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Method |Description
|GET _/v1/aspsp_ |Finds all ASPSPs by one of the next parameters BIC, BLZ (bank code), IBAN or Bank Name or by a set of
listed parameters.
|GET _/v1/aspsp/{aspsp-id}_ |Finds an ASPSP by ID.
