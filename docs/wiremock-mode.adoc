= WireMock Mode

== What is it?
WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. It is a library for stubbing and mocking web services,
that constructs an HTTP server that could be connected to as it would be to an actual web service.
For additional details please refer to the official http://wiremock.org/[WireMock] website.

Adapter uses WireMock to record communication routines with a bank, so users could check their TPP
implementation without actually querying a bank API.

Request/response records are called *stubs*. All captured (so far) stubs can be found under each adapter
main resources package in an identical to an adapter module name folder within *mappings* directory, e.g.
`adorsys-adapter/src/main/resources/adorsys-adapter/**mappings**`

== How to use it?
By default, it is turned off.

There are two ways to kickoff WireMock depending on how a user utilizes the Adapter:

- as a standalone application - a user will want to set `xs2a-adapter:wiremock:mode` property to **true**
on the `application.yml` under `xs2a-adapter-app` module.
- as a library - a user will need to pass a `WiremockHttpClientFactory` instance into `AdapterServiceLoader`
when initializing.

== How to verify authenticity?
Bank models and APIs may change over time. So the Adapter team provided a tool to check whether a recorded stub
is still actual.

`WiremockStubDifferenceDetectingInterceptor` (also referred here as _Validation interceptor_) is an interceptor that does verification.
If a difference detected the interceptor will add a special header to a response `X-GTW-ASPSP-CHANGES-DETECTED` with
a value of in what adapter changes occurred, in what stub file, and what part of it (e.g. request headers or response body)
mismatches. Additional details will be revealed in logs.

== How to use that?
By default, it is also turned off, and, similarly, there are two ways to start using this interceptor, depending on how
the Adapter is applied:

- as a standalone application - a user will want to set `xs2a-adapter:wiremock:validation:enabled` property to **true**
on the `application.yml` under `xs2a-adapter-app` module.
- as a library - a user will need to pass a `wiremockValidationEnabled` flag (*true* in this case) into `AdapterServiceLoader`
when initializing.

== What will change...
=== If WireMock Mode is on?
As it was mentioned before, there will be no communication with a bank. All requests will be resolved on the Adapter side
by the WireMock service and response will be constructed based on an available stub.

For example, AIS flow with EMBEDDED SCA in WireMock mode will look like this:

image::embedded_ais_wiremock_mode.png[Wiremock mode]

=== If WireMock Validation enabled
A client will communicate with a bank as usual, however, there will be additional steps on the adapter side for verifying
stubs genuine.

E.g., the same AIS flow but with WireMock Validation:

image::embedded_ais_wiremock_validation_enabled.png[Wiremock Validation enabled]

== Can I records my own stubs?
Sure thing!

*Note*: the Adapter itself doesn't provide tools to record stubs from the box.

You will need to get the WireMock Recorder by your own, here is the detailed instruction of how to http://wiremock.org/docs/record-playback/[record]
with Wiremock, and here is the link:wiremock.md[manual] of how to capture bank request/response specifically for an adapter.

We recommend a user following the Adapter naming convention regarding packages and stubs naming, at least for a proper work
of `WiremockStubDifferenceDetectingInterceptor`.

In general, stub name for an AIS call should be _ais-<operation>.json_, for a PIS call - _pis-<payment-service-first-word>-<payment-product-brief>-<operation>.json_,
package - _<adapter-module>/src/main/resources/<adapter-module>_. There are plenty of concrete instances in adapters, please take a look.
