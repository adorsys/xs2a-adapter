= Embedded Pre-Step

DKB solution provider Crealogix introduced their own authentication solution, which is called Embedded pre-authentication
or Embedded pre-step, which is not a part of Berlin Group PSD2 specification. The solution, as it can be implied from the
name, is a mix of the Embedded and OAuth2 approaches. When requesting for an access token TPP must add a PSU login and password
to a body in the call. TPP must call all PSD2 endpoints with an obtained access token included in the `PSD2-AUTHORIZATION` Bearer header.

The obtaining of an access token is mandatory for both AIS and PIS flows. The flows themselves much resemble the classical
Embedded approach. Moreover, adapter will not impose using specific DKB `PSD2-AUTHORIZATION` but maps it to a common `AUTHORIZATION` header
